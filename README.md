# Music Theory App
This repo is home to the personal project I started in my Object-Oriented Programming and Design course.
The project is an app that provides organized access to music theory content.
This app will evolve as my knowledge of music theory grows.

Predicted Challenges: 
1. Integrating Enharmonic Equivalents

Long Term Goals:
1. Integrate Enharmonic Equivalents
